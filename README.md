# CircuitPlaygroundBounceGame

This is my final project for Engineering 103 at Oregon State University designed for the Arduino Circuit Playground Express.

## Brief Rules Overview

A light bounces back and forth across the neopiexels on the board.
The goal of the game is hit the button when the light is in the middle (2) positions of the board. 
Each time the button is successfully timed, the score goes up and the game gets faster. 
This continues until you fail, in which the board alerts you of faliure and all neopixels are red until reset by sliding the switch.


## Inputs

Uses button on pin 4, and uses slide switch

## Outputs
Neopixel lights, speech library, plays tones
